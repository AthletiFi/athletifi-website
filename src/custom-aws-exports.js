/**
 * This file exists to provide a custom configuration for AWS Amplify, specifically for handling the OAuth redirect URLs correctly.
 *
 * Why This File Exists:
 * When using AWS Amplify, the `aws-exports.js` file is automatically generated by the Amplify CLI.
 * However, this file is automatically overwritten after every push. This means any manual changes to this file will be lost,
 * which can be problematic if you need to make specific adjustments that are not retained.
 *
 * In our case, we need to ensure the OAuth redirect URLs include the 'www' subdomain (e.g., `https://www.athleti.fi/resolve-auth/`).
 * However, after an automated redeployment, the auto-generated `aws-exports.js` file doesn't include this, causing issues with our authentication flow.
 *
 * We use this `custom-aws-exports.js` file to override specific configurations in the auto-generated `aws-exports.js` file. By doing so, we ensure our
 * application always uses the correct OAuth redirect URLs, regardless of any automated updates made by Amplify.
 *
 * How It Works:
 * 1. Import the auto-generated configuration from `aws-exports.js`.
 * 2. Programmatically add 'www' to the `redirectSignIn` and `redirectSignOut` URLs if they do not already include it.
 * 3. Export this customized configuration.
